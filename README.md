# CNS-Web

The CNS-Web application is a web server program I had written in my senior year of high school for my computer networking
& security teacher at Forbes Road CTC which was to be used during tours to replace students hand-writing their information
when expressing their interest in the classes. Said information was often illigible and so this rendered a lot of the
collection pointless. The web app eliminates this problem by providing a web form that is accessible by any computer
in the classroom when the tours are running that students may type their information into.
